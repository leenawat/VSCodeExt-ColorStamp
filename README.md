# Color Stamp

Forked from https://github.com/s3anmorrow/VSCodeExt-ColorStamp


This extension is for developers who typically have multiple VS Code windows open with different projects. It enables a quick and easy way to change the status bar color of each window for identification.

## Features

Change the color of the status bar to any of eight preset colors or your own color with a provided hexidecimal color code (#FF0000). The set status bar color will persist in the current workspace.


## Usage

After Installation press `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` and type in `Color Stamp`. 

Select from a series commands to set status bar to any color with hex code or one of eight built in colors.
